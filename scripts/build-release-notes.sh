#!/usr/bin/env bash
# build-release-notes.sh — Emit release notes for <tag> to stdout.
#
# Usage: build-release-notes.sh <tag>
#
# Resolution order:
#   1. If ./RELEASE_NOTES.md exists at repo root, print it verbatim and exit.
#      Use this to override for releases that deserve a hand-crafted summary.
#   2. Otherwise synthesize Markdown from `git log <prev>..HEAD`, bucketing
#      commits by the "type:" prefix we already use (feat / fix / docs / ci
#      / installer / release / vendor / chore).  Unprefixed commits fall
#      into "Other".
#   3. If no previous v* tag exists, treat this as the first release and
#      list the entire history.
#
# Callers:
#   - .github/workflows/release.yml (CI release notes)
#   - scripts/release.sh            (local `gh release create` uploader)
#
# Exits non-zero only on unexpected git failures; an empty commit range
# still produces a valid (if short) notes body.
